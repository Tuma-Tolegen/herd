				<h4>User tests</h4>
				<p>
				<strong>Conditions</strong>
				<br>
					For our User Testing Report we did 3 tests on our paper prototype and 3 tests on the website itself. The paper prototype tests were conducted before we started coding the website. Two website tests were conducted during the fourth version of the website and the last website test was conducted during the fifth version of the website. After that we improved imperfections in the design one more time, making our sixth version our final version. Because of COVID-19 we weren’t able to test the website on a lot of people outside our personal bubble, but we made it work very well. Eva did the three paper prototypes because she was the one to have the prototype at home. She tested on three of her classmates during a production house day: Anna, Sanne, and Tina. Lianne did the three website tests because she had exactly three people at home who were able to participate. She also coded the website and was quickly able to tell if the people were on the right track. She tested her two parents and her sister: Rob, Daniëlle, and Maud. 
				<br>
				<strong>Outcome Prototype</strong>
				<br>
					For the paper prototype test everything went perfect. None of our contestants made a mistake. They all had a laugh whilst doing the test, indicating they already enjoyed our website just by looking at the prototype. They went through their test very quickly and weren’t too hesitant about it. The only small thing Sanne Koelman told us, was that she almost made the mistake of looking for the teammembers at the about page. Sanne picked up on it before she actually told Eva to go to about, so we won’t be making any changes now. We will start making the app and if it turns out to happen again during the website tests, we will change the page name.
				<br>
				<strong>Outcome Website</strong>
				<br>
					For the website tests some minor mistakes were made. Rob and Danielle both messed up on the navbar leading them towards the teammembers page, like Sanne mentioned also. At first Rob didn’t notice the navbar and was stuck on the same page for the first assignment. When Lianne told him there were more pages, he was able to work the rest out. His other issues presented itself in the footer. When asked about the designer of the website, being Chiara, he scrolled to the footer where it read “Designed By Group 4.3”. Danielle had one other issue at the contact page. When not wanting to add a file to the form, she clicked on “No File” that the button registered as not having added anything yet. When clicking on it the folder with documents opened, and this repeated itself for a little while until Lianne stopped it. We made a few changes after this and proceeded to test our website on Maud. She did everything perfectly, without error or hesitation. We only resolved a few minor design imperfections, such as margins, after that.
				<br>
				<strong>Recommendations</strong>
				<br>
						Between Danielle and Maud’s test we changed the following:<br>
						We changed the navbar name of “About” to “About Bubble” and “Team” to “The Team” to avoid confusion over on what page to find the team members. <br>
						We changed the footer from “Designed By” to “Created By”, this to avoid confusion about the actual roles within the team. <br>
						We changed the notification “No File” to “No File Chosen” to avoid any confusion when submitting the contact form.

			<h4 class="explanation text-center">The font we selected embodied the character spirit of our brand for parents. The playful color yellow is balanced by a modern and clean font that expressed maturity, it's a very easy font to read especially since the target group of the brand is 40-50-year-old parents. 
The Raleway family font is a ‘superfamily it comes along with a selection of different styles and weights that give us as the designers more creative freedom. We worked with contrast so when there is yellow the text on top of it is white and when there is just a blank piece of the page the font will be black.</h4>
